# Scrum Master Workflow

## Sprint Management Framework

### 🎯 Sprint Goal Definition
Establish clear, measurable objectives for each sprint with specific deliverables and success criteria.

**Example Sprint Goals:**
- Clean up git graph, consolidate commits, and establish production-ready workflow
- Implement feature flag system for A/B testing capability
- Establish monitoring and performance baseline metrics

## 📋 Sprint Backlog Management

### Priority Framework

#### 🔴 High Priority (Current Sprint)
- **Git Graph Cleanup**: Squash commits into logical units
- **Branch Consolidation**: Remove stale feature branches  
- **Production Deployment**: Merge clean history to main
- **Feature Validation**: Verify critical functionality works

#### 🟡 Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
- **Release Process**: Document deployment workflow
- **Monitoring Setup**: Production health checks
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish metrics

#### 🟢 Low Priority (Future Sprints)
- **Feature Flag System**: A/B testing capability
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Advanced tracking
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline enhancements

## 📊 Current State Analysis Framework

### Git Branch Health Assessment
```
staging (current) - ✅ Current working branch
├── main - ⚠️ X commits behind staging  
├── feature/name - ⚠️ Feature branch status
├── historical-branch - ⚠️ Historical branch
└── old-feature - ⚠️ Old feature branch
```

### Commit Analysis Strategy
Track commits that need consolidation:
1. Feature implementation commits
2. Configuration fixes
3. Documentation updates
4. Bug fixes
5. Infrastructure changes

## 🔧 Git Cleanup Strategy

### Phase 1: Commit Squashing
**Goal**: Consolidate commits into logical units

**Proposed Squash Groups**:
1. **Infrastructure & Deployment**
   - Migration commits + deployment fixes + automation

2. **Repository & Documentation**
   - Configuration changes + documentation + policy updates

3. **Feature Implementation**
   - Keep feature commits as standalone logical units

### Phase 2: Branch Cleanup
**Branches to Delete**:
- Merged feature branches
- Outdated branches
- Historical migration branches

**Branches to Keep**:
- `main` (production)
- `staging` (current development)
- Active feature branches (review needed)

### Phase 3: Production Sync
1. Merge clean staging to main
2. Tag production release
3. Deploy to production
4. Verify critical functionality

## 📅 Sprint Schedule Framework

### Daily Standup Questions
1. **What did we complete yesterday?**
2. **What are we working on today?**
3. **What blockers do we have?**
4. **Are we on track for sprint goal?**

### Regular Check-ins
- **Every 30 min during cleanup**: Progress review
- **After each phase**: Validation checkpoint
- **End of session**: Sprint retrospective

## 🎖️ Definition of Done

### For Git Cleanup
- [ ] History reduced to logical, atomic commits
- [ ] All stale branches removed
- [ ] Clean linear history on main branch
- [ ] All changes deployed to production

### For Feature Completion
- [ ] Code reviewed and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Verified in production
- [ ] Performance impact measured

## 🚀 Action Items Template

### Immediate (Next 15 min)
1. **Commit current changes**
2. **Start planned work**
3. **First checkpoint** - Review progress

### Mid-Sprint (Next 30 min)
1. **Complete main objectives**
2. **Address blockers**
3. **Validate intermediate results**

### Final Sprint (Last 15 min)
1. **Deploy to production**
2. **Test critical functionality**
3. **Sprint retrospective**

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Git Health Metrics
- **Commit Count**: Reduce to logical units
- **Branch Count**: Maintain minimal active branches
- **History Clarity**: Linear, logical progression

### Production Readiness Metrics
- **Deployment Success**: Clean deploy without errors
- **Feature Functionality**: All critical features working
- **Performance**: No regression in metrics

### Team Velocity Metrics
- **Sprint Goal Achievement**: Percentage of objectives completed
- **Cycle Time**: Time from feature start to production
- **Lead Time**: Time from idea to delivery

## 🔄 Next Sprint Planning

### Backlog Refinement
1. **Feature Priority Assessment**
2. **Technical Debt Evaluation**
3. **Capacity Planning**
4. **Risk Assessment**

### Upcoming Features Framework
1. **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard**
2. **A/B Testing Framework** 
3. **Automated Workflows**
4. **Advanced User Management**

### Technical Debt Management
1. **Test Coverage Improvements**
2. **Performance Optimization**
3. **Security Audit**
4. **Documentation Updates**

## 🏆 Sprint Results Framework

### Success Criteria Assessment
- **Session Duration**: Planned vs actual
- **All Objectives**: Achievement percentage
- **Status**: Production readiness level

### Git Cleanup Results
- **Commits**: Before and after count
- **Branches**: Cleanup effectiveness
- **History**: Quality assessment
- **Tags**: Release management

### Infrastructure Status
- **Production**: Deployment success
- **Critical Features**: Functionality verification
- **Performance**: Baseline establishment
- **Testing**: Coverage and automation

### Next Sprint Readiness
- **Foundation**: Architecture assessment
- **Documentation**: Completeness check
- **Team Workflow**: Process maturity
- **Development**: Feature readiness
