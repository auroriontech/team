# Aurorion Teams MCP Implementation Backlog

## Project Vision
Deploy Aurorion Teams as locally-hosted MCP agents on Mac Mini M4 Pro with proper endpoints and model assignments.

## Sprint 1: Foundation Setup (Priority 1)

### Epic: Basic Infrastructure
- [ ] **SETUP-001**: Install and configure Ollama with initial models
- [ ] **SETUP-002**: Create basic MCP server structure for one agent (proof of concept)
- [ ] **SETUP-003**: Verify Mac Mini can host multiple concurrent agents
- [ ] **SETUP-004**: Document basic deployment workflow

### Epic: Model Selection & Testing
- [ ] **MODEL-001**: Download and test DeepSeek-R1 7B for Architect-Engineer
- [ ] **MODEL-002**: Download and test Gemma 3 27B for Tester-Reviewer  
- [ ] **MODEL-003**: Performance benchmark with 2-3 agents running simultaneously
- [ ] **MODEL-004**: Memory usage analysis and optimization

## Sprint 2: Core Agent Development (Priority 2)

### Epic: MCP Agent Implementation
- [ ] **AGENT-001**: Convert Architect-Engineer instruction set to MCP endpoint
- [ ] **AGENT-002**: Convert Tester-Reviewer instruction set to MCP endpoint
- [ ] **AGENT-003**: Implement standardized handoff protocol between agents
- [ ] **AGENT-004**: Create agent coordination/routing system

### Epic: Local Hosting Framework
- [ ] **HOST-001**: Choose and implement Docker vs native hosting approach
- [ ] **HOST-002**: Set up reverse proxy/gateway for agent endpoints
- [ ] **HOST-003**: Implement basic monitoring and health checks
- [ ] **HOST-004**: Create startup/shutdown automation scripts

## Sprint 3: Full Team Deployment (Priority 3)

### Epic: Remaining Agents
- [ ] **AGENT-005**: Deploy Optimizer-Watchdog agent
- [ ] **AGENT-006**: Deploy Scrum-Knowledge agent  
- [ ] **AGENT-007**: Deploy Morale-Catalyst agent
- [ ] **AGENT-008**: Deploy Technical Enablement agent
- [ ] **AGENT-009**: Deploy Standup Facilitator agent

### Epic: Integration & Testing
- [ ] **INT-001**: End-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] **INT-002**: Performance optimization under full load
- [ ] **INT-003**: Error handling and recovery procedures
- [ ] **INT-004**: Documentation and user guide creation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All agents accessible via MCP endpoints
- [ ] Mac Mini hosting stable under normal load
- [ ] Handoff protocols working between agents
- [ ] Basic monitoring and health checks operational
- [ ] Documentation complete for setup and usage

## Blockers & Dependencies
- **BLOCKER-001**: Need to choose MCP framework before agent development
- **BLOCKER-002**: Model performance testing required before agent assignments
- **DEPENDENCY-001**: Docker/hosting decision affects all agent development

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **SETUP-001**: Install Ollama and test first model
2. **Choose MCP Framework**: Select from research options
3. **Create proof-of-concept**: Single agent MCP endpoint

**Process Control**: No new features or research until Sprint 1 tasks are completed.
