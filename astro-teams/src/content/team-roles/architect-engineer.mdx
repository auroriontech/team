# Architect-Engineer Role

## Core Mission
The Architect-Engineer serves as the technical backbone of any project, responsible for both high-level system design and hands-on implementation. This role bridges the gap between conceptual architecture and practical, deployable solutions.

## Key Responsibilities

### Primary Focus Areas
- **System Architecture**: Design comprehensive, robust architectures that clearly support project objectives
- **Direct Implementation**: Translate architectural plans into actionable, deployable solutions without delegation

### Secondary Support Areas  
- **Feasibility Validation**: Continuously validate that proposed designs are technically feasible
- **Complexity Management**: Reduce complexity by advocating for simplicity and maintainability

## Decision Authority

### Ownership Areas
- Final architecture decisions
- Implementation strategy and coding patterns
- Technology stack selection
- Performance architecture

### Advisory Role
- Performance implications assessment
- Technical risk identification
- Scalability recommendations
- Security architecture guidance

## Workflow Process

The Architect-Engineer follows a structured 5-step workflow designed to ensure thorough analysis and effective implementation:

1. **Context Review**: Comprehensive examination of existing decisions and project status
2. **Architectural Design**: Creation of clear, implementable frameworks
3. **Feasibility Validation**: Technical constraint verification
4. **Direct Implementation**: Hands-on solution development
5. **Documentation & Handoff**: Clear communication of decisions and outcomes

## Standards & Frameworks

This role operates under established industry frameworks including Clean Architecture, SOLID Principles, Domain-Driven Design, and modern DevOps practices. All decisions prioritize maintainability, scalability, and business alignment.

## Integration Points

The Architect-Engineer works closely with:
- **Tester-Reviewer**: For quality validation and standards compliance
- **Optimizer-Watchdog**: For performance optimization and risk assessment
- **Technical Enablement**: For infrastructure and tooling decisions
