# Simple Non-Disclosure Agreement

**Between you and Aurorion**

## The Basics

I'm building something new with Aurorion, and I need to keep it confidential while it's in development. By working with this code, you're agreeing to keep things private.

## What's Confidential?

Pretty much everything you see here:
- The AI agent system I'm building
- How it works and how it's designed
- The code, documentation, and ideas
- Any business plans or strategies you might see

## What I'm Asking You to Do

Simple stuff:
- Don't share this with anyone outside our agreed work
- Don't post about it online or discuss it publicly (unless I give you written permission)
- Don't use my ideas for your own projects (without permission and attribution)
- Treat it like you'd want your own startup ideas treated

## Want to Share or Use Something?

That's cool! Just:
- Ask me first - I'm usually reasonable about these things
- Get written permission (email is fine)
- Include proper attribution when you share/use it
- Respect any conditions I might have

## What About Other People's Code?

When we're working on code for others (like GetCoverPro for Gabor):
- Their code stays theirs
- My system stays mine
- We keep everything properly separated
- This NDA only covers the Aurorion system, not their code

## How Long?

Let's keep this simple - 3 years from when you last saw the code. That should cover the important development and launch period.

## If Something Goes Wrong

Look, we're all reasonable people. If there's an accidental disclosure:
- Tell me immediately
- We'll work together to fix it
- But intentional breaches could lead to legal action (I'd rather avoid that)

## The Legal Bit

- Governed by UK law
- We'll try to resolve things amicably first
- Standard startup protections apply

## Why This Matters

I'm a founder building something I believe in. This NDA helps protect that work while I get it ready for the world. I appreciate your understanding and respect for the journey.
